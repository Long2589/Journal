					<h2>My First Day at Portland Code School</h2>
					<h3>So far, so good</h3>
				</header>
				<div class="articleBody">
					<p>My experience with Portland Code School is off to a good start. We did an icebreaker exercise at the beginning of class, which helped me learn a few people's names (a good thing, since I'm terrible with names). I went through a lot of Treehouse videos prior to this class, so most of the terms discussed in class were familiar. I'm looking forward to learning more!</p>

					<p>Today I learned about Lorem Ipsum generators. Check this out sweet text, courtesy of <a href="http://www.cupcakeipsum.com">Cupcake Ipsum</a>:</p>

					<h2>Day 3</h2>
					<h3>Starting to "Git" It</h3>
				</header>
				<div class="articleBody">
					<p>Al's lecture and drawing on the board helped solidify some of the things I've been learning about  HTML, but was still confused about. In particular, I appreciated learning some of the distinctions between div, div, main, etc. Also, I got some great help using Git, and I'm starting to feel *a little* more comfortable with it. One of the main obstacles for me is that the terminal is so foreign, and I haven't memorized the commands I need to use. Now that I realize this lack of command line knowledge is holding me back, I'm going to spend some quality time between now and the next class reviewing this topic.</p>

					<h2>Day 5</h2>
					<h3>Two steps forward, one step back</h3>
				</header>
				<div class="articleBody">
					<p>It felt good to be back in class tonight after missing last Thursday. We talked a little bit about Git, and then we joined up with the people at Hack and Help to watch Al's presentation on Chrome Developer Tools. I can't believe how much information is available using Developer Tools! I will definitely be using it as a resource for future work. After the presentation, Stacy was incredibly helpful in figuring out a Git issue I was having. Somewhere along the way, my file structure had gotten messed up and Git wasn't tracking my most recent changes. She helped me sort it all out though, and things are back on track!</p>

		        <div class="articleBody">
		          	<p>Tonight's class was good!  We went over some details of the final project, and we teamed up in groups to start working on it. I really like the people I'm working with, and I think we will work well together. There's a certain energy in collaborating that I love - whether it's playing music with other people or working on a project like this. I left class feeling excited about this opportunity for collaboration.</p>

		          	<p>We spent most of this evening's class working on our group project. I designed a custom header/logo for our page using Canva, but I was having trouble getting it to fit the full length of the page. I was also having some issues with the floats on the page, and I spent hours messing with the code, trying to fix the problem. Finally, I plugged my css into the CSS Lint website (thank you for telling me about this, Al!!) and realized that the entire problem was occurring because I left out a bracket ( } ). Well. Lesson learned.</p>
